Note: MonoDetour is a library for developers; it does nothing by itself.

## Why Use MonoDetour?

MonoDetour is an alternative to HarmonyX or MonoMod.RuntimeDetour for detouring. It attempts to improve on the hooking experience as much as possible. See <https://monodetour.github.io/getting-started/why-monodetour/> to learn more.
